# Website Fixes Documentation

This document summarizes the issues identified and the fixes applied to the Sarraa website code.

## Issues Identified

1.  **Missing Product Images:** The console logs indicated 404 errors for several product images:
    *   `chanel_no5.jpg`
    *   `dior_foundation.jpg`
    *   `huda_brushes.jpg`
    *   `essie_nailpolish.jpg`
    These images were referenced in `js/product.js` and `js/homepage.js` but were not present in the `/images/products/brands/` directory.

2.  **Cart Functionality Error:** The console log showed an error: `addProductToCart function not found. Ensure cart.js is loaded.`
    *   Analysis revealed that `js/product.js` (specifically the `addToCart` function within it) was attempting to call a function named `addProductToCart`.
    *   However, the actual function defined in `js/cart.js` for adding items to the cart is named `addToCart`.

## Fixes Applied

1.  **Image References Updated:**
    *   The references to the missing images (`chanel_no5.jpg`, `dior_foundation.jpg`, `huda_brushes.jpg`, `essie_nailpolish.jpg`) in both `js/product.js` and `js/homepage.js` were updated.
    *   These references now point to the existing placeholder image: `images/product-placeholder.jpg`.
    *   This ensures that the product listings display an image, preventing 404 errors, although the specific product images are still missing from the provided files.

2.  **Cart Function Call Corrected:**
    *   The function call within the `addToCart` function in `js/product.js` was corrected.
    *   It now correctly calls `addToCart(productId, quantity)` (referencing the function defined in `cart.js`) instead of the non-existent `addProductToCart`.
    *   The corresponding `console.error` message within the `else` block in `js/product.js` was also updated to reflect the correct function name (`addToCart`) for accurate debugging information if `cart.js` fails to load properly in the future.
